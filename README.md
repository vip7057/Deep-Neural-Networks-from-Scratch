# Deep Neural Network (FCN) from Scratch

This project implements various Deep Neural Network (DNN) frameworks such as ***Fully Connected Network(FCN), Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network(RNN)*** in Python using **Numpy and Scipy** only. It allows users to understand the inner workings of various neural network components. 

**For more details on each network functionality, please refer to the corresponding folders -> FCN, CNN, RNN.**
